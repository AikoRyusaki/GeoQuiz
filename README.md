# GeoQuiz
The educational project was implemented using the book "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 4th Edition" (Authors: Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Gardner, Kristin Marsicano).
The application tests how well the user knows geography. The user answers a question by pressing the True or False button, and GeoQuiz instantly provides them with the result.
